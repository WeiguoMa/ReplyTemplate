# Response Letter LaTeX Class (`responseletter.cls`)

This LaTeX class (`responseletter.cls`) is designed to help authors prepare detailed response letters to reviewers during the manuscript submission process. This template provides a structured format for addressing each comment made by the reviewers and summarizing the changes made to the manuscript.

## Overview of the Format

The response letter generated by this class typically follows this structure:

### 1. Article Information Section

At the beginning of the document, the essential details about the manuscript are displayed, including:

- **Article Number**: Reference number assigned to the manuscript.
- **Article Title**: Full title of the manuscript.
- **Authors**: Names of the authors.

This information is presented in the following format:

```
Re: [Article Number]

[Article Title]

By [Authors]
```

### 2. To Editors

```
Dear Editor,
...
```

### 3. Point-to-Point Responses

This section contains detailed responses to each of the comments provided by the referees. The format is organized as follows:

```
————————————————————————

[Ordinal] Report of the [Ordinal] Referee – [Article Info]

————————————————————————

Referee #[N] commented:

[Text of the referee's comment.]

Our response:

[Detailed response to the comment.]

Referee #[N] commented:

[Text of the referee's next comment.]

Our response:

[Detailed response to the comment.]
```

- **Ordinal**: The ordinal number corresponds to the review round and the referee (e.g., "First", "Second").
- **Referee #[N]**: Specifies which referee’s comment is being addressed (e.g., Referee #1, Referee #2).
- **Comment and Response**: Each comment from the referee is directly followed by the author's response.

### 4. Summary of Changes

At the end of the response letter, a summary of all major changes made to the manuscript is provided:

```
**************

All our main changes are marked in blue in the revised manuscript. Below is a summary of the changes:

1. [Description of the first change];
2. [Description of the second change];
3. [Description of the third change].
```

This summary assists reviewers and editors in quickly identifying the modifications made to the manuscript.
